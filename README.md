## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Move to the appropriate directory `cd cov19`
3.  To install all dependencies run `npm install` or `yarn`
4.  In order to use this app you need set up communication with 
    Rest API backend, to set it up open `package.json` and configure scripts config fields like `API_HOST={your_api_domain}`
5.  At this point you can run `npm run build` to get into production,  
    or `npm run dev` to use development environment to see changes in runtime

Now you're ready to rumble!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! Boilerplate can not work properly without API set up and running simultaneously.
